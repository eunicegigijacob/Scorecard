This is a project done as part of the Scrimba's frontend developer course.
It's aim is to demonstrate basic javascript skills in making a page inerractive.
The project itself keeps track of team scores in a basketball game by giving the oppotunity of the user to add scores to each team and also get a visual of who the winner is.
